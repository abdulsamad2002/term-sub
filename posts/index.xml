&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threat hunting is a proactive cybersecurity practice that involves actively searching for hidden threats within an organization&amp;rsquo;s network. Unlike traditional security operations that rely on alerts from security information and event management (SIEM) systems, threat hunting assumes that adversaries have already bypassed defenses and are lurking within the environment. By adopting an &amp;ldquo;assume breach&amp;rdquo; mentality, organizations can proactively identify and eliminate threats before they cause significant damage. This comprehensive guide explores how organizations can implement threat hunting effectively as part of their blue team strategy, covering tools, techniques, best practices, and real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Threat hunting is a proactive cybersecurity practice that involves actively searching for hidden threats within an organization&rsquo;s network. Unlike traditional security operations that rely on alerts from security information and event management (SIEM) systems, threat hunting assumes that adversaries have already bypassed defenses and are lurking within the environment. By adopting an &ldquo;assume breach&rdquo; mentality, organizations can proactively identify and eliminate threats before they cause significant damage. This comprehensive guide explores how organizations can implement threat hunting effectively as part of their blue team strategy, covering tools, techniques, best practices, and real-world applications.</p>
<h2 id="the-need-for-threat-hunting">The Need for Threat Hunting</h2>
<p>Traditional security measures, such as firewalls, antivirus software, and SIEMs, are essential but reactive in nature. Threat actors are constantly evolving, leveraging advanced tactics to evade detection. Some of the key reasons organizations need threat hunting include:</p>
<h3 id="advanced-persistent-threats-apts">Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</h3>
<p>Sophisticated adversaries maintain long-term access to systems while evading detection through stealth techniques such as process injection, fileless malware, and custom backdoors. APTs often persist in an organization for months or even years before being discovered, making proactive threat hunting essential.</p>
<p>Common APT techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process hollowing and DLL injection</li>
<li>Living off the land binaries (LOLBins)</li>
<li>Timestomping and log manipulation</li>
<li>Custom command-and-control (C2) protocols</li>
<li>Supply chain compromises</li>
<li>Sophisticated data exfiltration methods</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zero-day-exploits">Zero-Day Exploits</h3>
<p>Attackers frequently target vulnerabilities before patches are available. Since traditional security tools rely on signature-based detection, they fail to identify and mitigate zero-day threats effectively. Threat hunting allows organizations to analyze behavioral patterns and anomalous activities that might indicate exploitation attempts.</p>
<p>Key aspects of zero-day hunting include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory analysis for unusual process behavior</li>
<li>Network traffic analysis for anomalous patterns</li>
<li>Registry monitoring for persistence mechanisms</li>
<li>File system changes in sensitive directories</li>
<li>Unusual service creation or modification</li>
<li>Suspicious driver loading activities</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="insider-threats">Insider Threats</h3>
<p>Not all cyber threats come from external actors; insiders with legitimate access can misuse their privileges to exfiltrate sensitive data, deploy malware, or sabotage critical systems. Threat hunting helps detect suspicious activities such as unauthorized access attempts, abnormal file transfers, and privilege escalation.</p>
<p>Common insider threat indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>After-hours system access</li>
<li>Mass file downloads or uploads</li>
<li>Unauthorized USB device usage</li>
<li>Excessive privileged account usage</li>
<li>Unusual remote access patterns</li>
<li>Abnormal database queries</li>
<li>Email forwarding rules creation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alert-fatigue">Alert Fatigue</h3>
<p>Security teams often deal with thousands of alerts daily, many of which turn out to be false positives. This can lead to alert fatigue, causing analysts to overlook genuine threats. Threat hunting helps refine detection mechanisms by focusing on high-fidelity indicators of compromise (IoCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).</p>
<p>Strategies to combat alert fatigue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk-based alert prioritization</li>
<li>Machine learning for alert correlation</li>
<li>Automated alert enrichment</li>
<li>Context-aware alert scoring</li>
<li>Alert clustering and deduplication</li>
<li>Playbook-driven response automation</li>
<li>Regular tuning of detection rules</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="evolving-threat-landscape">Evolving Threat Landscape</h3>
<p>Cybercriminals continuously evolve their attack techniques, incorporating sophisticated tactics such as Living Off the Land (LotL), fileless malware, and supply chain attacks. Traditional defenses may not detect these threats, making proactive threat hunting critical.</p>
<p>Recent attack trends include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud service abuse</li>
<li>Container escape techniques</li>
<li>Browser-based crypto mining</li>
<li>Software supply chain poisoning</li>
<li>Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)</li>
<li>IoT botnet operations</li>
<li>AI-powered attack automation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="regulatory-compliance">Regulatory Compliance</h3>
<p>Various compliance frameworks, such as NIST, ISO 27001, and GDPR, emphasize proactive security measures. Threat hunting aligns with these guidelines by enhancing an organization&rsquo;s ability to detect, respond to, and mitigate threats effectively.</p>
<p>Compliance requirements often include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular security assessments</li>
<li>Continuous monitoring</li>
<li>Incident response capabilities</li>
<li>Audit trail maintenance</li>
<li>Data protection measures</li>
<li>Risk assessment procedures</li>
<li>Security awareness training</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="threat-hunting-frameworks">Threat Hunting Frameworks</h2>
<p>Several frameworks guide organizations in implementing structured threat-hunting programs. These frameworks help analysts map adversary behaviors, develop hypotheses, and conduct systematic investigations.</p>
<h3 id="1-mitre-attck-framework">1. MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework</h3>
<p>MITRE ATT&amp;CK is a comprehensive knowledge base that documents adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). It helps threat hunters identify attack patterns, correlate threat activities, and develop detection rules.</p>
<p>Key components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise ATT&amp;CK Matrix</li>
<li>Mobile ATT&amp;CK Matrix</li>
<li>Cloud ATT&amp;CK Matrix</li>
<li>ICS ATT&amp;CK Matrix</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mapping existing security controls to ATT&amp;CK techniques</li>
<li>Developing detection rules based on technique metadata</li>
<li>Creating hunt teams aligned with specific tactics</li>
<li>Building threat intelligence feeds around known TTPs</li>
<li>Establishing metrics for technique coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Tool integration examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sigma rules for SIEM integration</li>
<li>YARA rules for malware detection</li>
<li>Atomic Red Team for technique validation</li>
<li>ATT&amp;CK Navigator for visualization</li>
<li>MITRE CAR analytics</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="introduction-to-siem">Introduction to SIEM</h3>
<p>In the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, the ability to detect, respond to, and mitigate threats in real time is a critical component of any organization’s defense strategy. <strong>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</strong> systems have emerged as one of the cornerstones of modern security operations. SIEM solutions provide organizations with centralized visibility into their IT environment, offering comprehensive tools to collect, analyze, and correlate log data from a variety of sources. By automating these processes, SIEM solutions help security operations teams detect malicious activities, respond faster to incidents, and comply with security regulations.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-siem">What is a SIEM?</h3>
<p>At its core, a SIEM is a software solution designed to provide real-time visibility into an organization’s security posture. It aggregates logs, events, and security-related data from various systems within the infrastructure, including network devices, endpoints, servers, applications, databases, and cloud platforms. By consolidating and analyzing these data streams, a SIEM can identify suspicious activities, generate alerts, and aid in the detection of complex security incidents.</p>
<p><strong>SIEM</strong> is not just a passive log management tool; it integrates both real-time monitoring and historical analysis capabilities, empowering security analysts to investigate threats, spot vulnerabilities, and proactively enhance an organization’s security posture. The dual nature of <strong>Security Information Management (SIM)</strong> and <strong>Security Event Management (SEM)</strong> found in SIEM systems allows them to serve both as a tool for historical data storage and analysis, as well as a system for detecting immediate threats.</p>
<h3 id="key-components-of-a-siem-system">Key Components of a SIEM System</h3>
<p>The functioning of a SIEM system revolves around several core components that work in tandem to ensure the effective aggregation, correlation, analysis, and management of security data. These components can be broken down as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Collection (Log Aggregation):</strong>
The first step in any SIEM process is the collection of data from across the organization’s network. This data may come from various sources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network Devices:</strong> Firewalls, routers, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Endpoints:</strong> Desktops, laptops, mobile devices, and virtual machines.</li>
<li><strong>Servers:</strong> Both physical and virtual servers (e.g., web servers, file servers, application servers).</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> Logs from cloud-based resources like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Security Devices:</strong> Security tools like antivirus systems, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, vulnerability management platforms, and others.</li>
<li><strong>Applications and Databases:</strong> Logs from business-critical applications such as CRM systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, and database management systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data is often collected using protocols like <strong>Syslog</strong>, <strong>SNMP</strong>, or <strong>Windows Event Forwarding</strong>, ensuring that all devices, systems, and applications generate logs in a format that can be ingested by the SIEM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Normalization:</strong>
Log data from different sources, devices, and applications typically comes in diverse formats. SIEM systems normalize this data, transforming it into a standard format to make analysis consistent across all data types. <strong>Normalization</strong> involves converting data into a common data structure, ensuring that logs from different vendors and systems are interoperable and easily analyzed.</p>
<p>For instance, a login event from a firewall might be recorded differently than a login event from an Active Directory server, but normalization allows both to be presented in a standardized format, making it easier for security analysts to understand and compare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Correlation and Rule-Based Analysis:</strong>
One of the most critical functions of a SIEM system is its ability to <strong>correlate</strong> data from multiple sources. Correlation involves looking for relationships or patterns in the data that may indicate a security threat. Rather than simply collecting and displaying raw logs, a SIEM uses a combination of predefined correlation rules, heuristics, and machine learning to analyze and correlate events across multiple systems.</p>
<p>For example, a correlation rule might look for a pattern such as multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login from the same account or IP address. This behavior could indicate a brute force attack. The <strong>correlation engine</strong> uses predefined and customizable rules to identify patterns indicative of various attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.</p>
<p>Modern SIEM systems have evolved to incorporate <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>. These technologies enable the SIEM to go beyond predefined rules, identifying anomalous or suspicious behavior that does not fit known attack patterns. This is especially important for detecting advanced persistent threats (APTs) or zero-day vulnerabilities that traditional correlation rules may miss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alerting and Notification:</strong>
Once an event or a series of correlated events is identified as suspicious or malicious, the SIEM generates an <strong>alert</strong>. Alerts are categorized based on the severity and potential impact of the detected activity. A well-configured SIEM will filter out <strong>false positives</strong>, ensuring that analysts are alerted to only the most critical or relevant events. These alerts are sent to the SOC team in real-time, often through dashboards, email notifications, or integration with ticketing systems like ServiceNow.</p>
<p>Alerts are designed to prioritize incidents, helping security analysts focus their attention on the most pressing security concerns. In a high-volume environment, false positives can lead to alert fatigue, so a SIEM system must have robust filtering and fine-tuning mechanisms to improve the quality of alerts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incident Response and Management:</strong>
One of the most important features of a SIEM is its integration with incident response workflows. When an alert is generated, the SIEM can trigger an automated workflow to initiate an investigation and response. Depending on the severity, the SIEM may create tickets for the security team, assigning specific individuals or teams to handle the incident.</p>
<p>The incident response process within a SIEM may involve:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Triage:</strong> Determining whether the alert is a false positive or a genuine security threat.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation:</strong> Delving deeper into the event data to understand the context of the alert and determining its root cause.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation and Containment:</strong> Taking steps to prevent the attack from spreading, such as isolating compromised systems or blocking malicious IP addresses.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Restoring systems and services to normal operations after mitigating the threat.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Incident Analysis:</strong> Analyzing the incident to improve detection and response capabilities for the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Retention and Reporting:</strong>
Data retention is crucial for compliance and forensic investigations. SIEM systems are designed to store logs and events for extended periods, enabling security teams to perform long-term analysis, investigate historical incidents, and comply with regulatory requirements. The retention period often depends on industry regulations, with some organizations required to store data for years.</p>
<p>SIEMs also generate <strong>compliance reports</strong> that provide detailed insights into security events, user behavior, and system vulnerabilities. These reports are essential for auditing purposes and demonstrate that the organization is meeting the necessary security standards and regulations, such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="core-use-cases-of-siem-in-a-soc">Core Use Cases of SIEM in a SOC</h3>
<p>A SOC (Security Operations Center) is responsible for detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. SIEM systems play a pivotal role in supporting SOC operations by offering the tools needed to monitor network traffic, detect threats, and manage incidents efficiently. Below are the primary use cases of SIEM in a SOC:</p>
<h4 id="1-threat-detection">1. <strong>Threat Detection</strong></h4>
<p>Real-time monitoring and event correlation are the foundations of threat detection. SIEM systems help SOC analysts identify suspicious activity across the entire IT ecosystem. By correlating data from firewalls, servers, endpoints, and applications, a SIEM can identify patterns that indicate possible security threats such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brute Force Attacks</strong>: Multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login.</li>
<li><strong>Insider Threats</strong>: Unusual activity by an employee accessing systems or data they shouldn’t.</li>
<li><strong>Lateral Movement</strong>: A user or attacker moving across the network to escalate privileges or access sensitive data.</li>
<li><strong>Data Exfiltration</strong>: Unexpected large data transfers or uploads to external IP addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>A SIEM’s ability to correlate and analyze data across multiple systems enables SOC analysts to detect complex threats that may otherwise go unnoticed.</p>
<h4 id="2-incident-response-and-management">2. <strong>Incident Response and Management</strong></h4>
<p>Once a threat is detected, a SIEM system helps streamline the incident response process. SOC teams can use the SIEM’s centralized interface to quickly access logs, alerts, and contextual data to determine the cause of an incident and assess its severity. Furthermore, SIEMs integrate with incident response tools to automate or orchestrate response actions, minimizing response times.</p>
<h4 id="3-security-posture-improvement">3. <strong>Security Posture Improvement</strong></h4>
<p>Through continuous monitoring, historical analysis, and reporting, SIEM systems provide valuable insights into an organization’s overall security posture. SOC teams can track trends in attacks, identify recurring vulnerabilities, and measure the effectiveness of security controls. By leveraging data collected by the SIEM, organizations can refine their security policies, strengthen their defenses, and proactively address areas of weakness.</p>
<h4 id="4-compliance-and-auditing">4. <strong>Compliance and Auditing</strong></h4>
<p>Many industries require strict adherence to regulatory standards such as <strong>HIPAA</strong>, <strong>PCI-DSS</strong>, <strong>GDPR</strong>, and <strong>SOX</strong>. SIEM systems help organizations comply with these regulations by providing automated reporting and log retention features. Additionally, they offer continuous monitoring to ensure that policies are followed and that any deviations are immediately flagged for investigation.</p>
<h4 id="5-threat-intelligence-integration">5. <strong>Threat Intelligence Integration</strong></h4>
<p>Modern SIEM systems can integrate with <strong>threat intelligence feeds</strong>, enriching the detection capabilities with information about emerging threats, tactics, and indicators of compromise (IOCs). By integrating external intelligence into the SIEM, SOC analysts can better understand the nature of potential threats and respond with greater accuracy.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-and-limitations-of-siem">Challenges and Limitations of SIEM</h3>
<p>While SIEM systems offer immense value, there are some challenges and limitations that organizations need to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>False Positives and Alert Fatigue</strong>: Poorly tuned correlation rules can lead to an overwhelming number of alerts, many of which may be false positives. This can lead to alert fatigue, where analysts miss important alerts due to the volume of notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity in Deployment</strong>: SIEM deployment can be complex, requiring careful planning and expertise to integrate various data sources and tune the system for optimal performance.</li>
<li><strong>High Costs</strong>: SIEM solutions can be costly, both in terms of licensing and ongoing operational overhead, including storage, personnel, and maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability Issues</strong>: As organizations grow, their SIEM systems need to scale accordingly. Managing large volumes of log data can become challenging, and maintaining the SIEM’s performance while scaling up is a common issue for growing organizations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>SIEM systems have become indispensable tools for modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs). They provide the necessary infrastructure for detecting, investigating, and mitigating security threats in real-time, all while offering valuable insights into an organization&rsquo;s security posture. While SIEM systems come with challenges such as high costs and the potential for false positives, their contribution to enhancing cybersecurity operations cannot be overstated.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, Security Operations Centers (SOCs) play a crucial role in detecting, analyzing, and responding to threats. Given the vast amount of logs, alerts, and data that SOC analysts handle daily, automation becomes a necessity. One of the most efficient and widely used automation tools in a SOC is Bash scripting.</p>
<h2 id="why-bash">Why Bash?</h2>
<p>Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a powerful scripting language primarily used in Linux environments. Since most security tools, log management systems, and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions are deployed on Linux-based infrastructures, Bash provides a seamless way to automate security tasks. Here are a few reasons why Bash is indispensable in a SOC:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native to Linux</strong>: Most SOC environments operate on Linux, making Bash an easily accessible tool.</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight and Fast</strong>: Unlike complex programming languages, Bash scripts run quickly and efficiently with minimal resource consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with Security Tools</strong>: Bash can be used to automate tasks involving tools like tcpdump, Wireshark, OSSEC, Suricata, and SIEM solutions like Splunk and ELK Stack.</li>
<li><strong>Task Automation</strong>: From log analysis to incident response, Bash scripts can handle repetitive tasks, improving efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applications-of-bash-automation-in-a-soc">Applications of Bash Automation in a SOC</h2>
<h3 id="1-log-parsing-and-analysis">1. Log Parsing and Analysis</h3>
<p>SOC analysts deal with vast amounts of logs from firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and endpoint security tools. Manually analyzing logs is time-consuming and error-prone. Bash scripts can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract relevant information (e.g., filtering logs for specific IPs, error codes, or patterns).</li>
<li>Automate correlation of logs from multiple sources.</li>
<li>Convert logs into structured formats (e.g., CSV or JSON) for further analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-incident-response-automation">2. Incident Response Automation</h3>
<p>When an alert is triggered, quick action is required. Bash automation can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check logs for indicators of compromise (IOCs).</li>
<li>Retrieve real-time process or network activity using <code>ps</code>, <code>netstat</code>, and <code>lsof</code>.</li>
<li>Terminate malicious processes automatically.</li>
<li>Send alerts and generate incident reports.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-threat-intelligence-integration">3. Threat Intelligence Integration</h3>
<p>SOC teams frequently rely on threat intelligence feeds to identify emerging threats. Bash scripts can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetch threat intelligence data from open-source threat intelligence platforms (OTX, MISP, etc.).</li>
<li>Cross-check logs against known malicious IPs, hashes, and domains.</li>
<li>Automate the blocking of malicious IPs in firewalls or intrusion prevention systems (IPS).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-automating-forensic-investigations">4. Automating Forensic Investigations</h3>
<p>Forensic analysis is a key component of incident response. Bash scripts can assist by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting system snapshots (e.g., running processes, active network connections).</li>
<li>Extracting artifacts such as SSH history, modified files, and login attempts.</li>
<li>Hashing files for integrity checks and evidence collection.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-user-and-network-monitoring">5. User and Network Monitoring</h3>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring user login activity and detecting unauthorized access attempts.</li>
<li>Automating the detection of suspicious commands executed by users.</li>
<li>Checking for anomalies in network traffic patterns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-automated-report-generation">6. Automated Report Generation</h3>
<p>SOC analysts often need to generate daily or weekly reports on security incidents and system health. Bash scripts can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate log data and extract key insights.</li>
<li>Format data into readable reports (HTML, CSV, or JSON).</li>
<li>Send reports via email or upload them to dashboards.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-world-example-bash-script-for-log-analysis">Real-World Example: Bash Script for Log Analysis</h2>
<p>Here’s a simple Bash script that extracts failed SSH login attempts from logs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>LOGFILE<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/var/log/auth.log&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Failed SSH login attempts:&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>grep <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Failed password&#34;</span> $LOGFILE | awk <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;{print $1, $2, $3, $9, $11}&#39;</span> | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This script extracts failed SSH login attempts, providing insights into potential brute-force attacks.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bash automation is a game-changer in SOC operations, allowing analysts to handle large volumes of data efficiently while reducing manual effort. By leveraging Bash scripting, SOC teams can enhance log analysis, automate incident response, streamline forensic investigations, and integrate threat intelligence. Mastering Bash is an essential skill for any SOC analyst looking to improve productivity and threat detection capabilities.</p>

            <title>The CIA Triad</title>
            <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/post3/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The CIA triad is an information security model that is used in consideration throughout creating a security policy. This model has an extensive background, ranging from being used in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This history is because the security of information (information security) does not start and/or end with cybersecurity, but instead, applies to scenarios like filing, record storage, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consisting of three sections: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA), this model has quickly become an industry standard today. This model should help determine the value of data that it applies to, and in turn, the attention it needs from the business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The CIA triad is unlike a traditional model where you have individual sections; instead, it is a continuous cycle. Whilst the three elements to the CIA triad can arguably overlap, if even just one element is not met, then the other two are rendered useless (similar to the fire triangle). If a security policy does not answer these three sections, it is seldom an effective security policy.</p>
<p>Whilst the three elements to the CIA triad are arguably self-explanatory, let&rsquo;s explore these and contextualise them into cybersecurity.</p>

alt="Confidentiality"></p>
<h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2>
<p>This element is the protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse. Organisations will always have some form of sensitive data stored on their systems. To provide confidentiality is to protect this data from parties that it is not intended for.</p>
<p>There are many real-world examples for this, for example, employee records and accounting documents will be considered sensitive. Confidentiality will be provided in the sense that only HR administrators will access employee records, where vetting and tight access controls are in place. Accounting records are less valuable (and therefore less sensitive), so not as stringent access controls would be in place for these documents. Or, for example, governments using a sensitivity classification rating system (top-secret, classified, unclassified)</p>

<h2 id="integrity">Integrity</h2>
<p>The CIA triad element of integrity is the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made. It is possible for the information to change because of careless access and use, errors in the information system, or unauthorized access and use. In the CIA triad, integrity is maintained when the information remains unchanged during storage, transmission, and usage not involving modification to the information. Steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered by unauthorised people (for example, in a breach of confidentiality).</p>
<p>Many defences to ensure integrity can be put in place. Access control and rigorous authentication can help prevent authorized users from making unauthorized changes. Hash verifications and digital signatures can help ensure that transactions are authentic and that files have not been modified or corrupted.</p>

<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>
<p>In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user.</p>
<p>The main concern in the CIA triad is that the information should be available when authorised users need to access it.</p>
<p>Availability is very often a key benchmark for an organisation. For example, having 99.99% uptime on their websites or systems (this is laid out in Service Level Agreements). When a system is unavailable, it often results in damage to an organisations reputation and loss of finances. Availability is achieved through a combination of many elements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having reliable and well-tested hardware for their information technology servers (i.e. reputable servers)</li>
<li>Having redundant technology and services in the case of failure of the primary</li>
<li>Implementing well-versed security protocols to protect technology and services from attack</li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Vulnerability assessment (VA) is a critical process in cybersecurity that involves identifying, analyzing, and mitigating security weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications. It is a proactive approach that helps organizations reduce their attack surface and strengthen their security posture. This article delves into the methodologies, tools, and best practices involved in vulnerability assessment.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-vulnerability-assessment">Understanding Vulnerability Assessment</h2>
<p>A vulnerability is any flaw or weakness that could be exploited by an attacker to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system. A vulnerability assessment systematically identifies and quantifies such weaknesses before they can be exploited.</p>
<h3 id="key-phases-of-vulnerability-assessment">Key Phases of Vulnerability Assessment</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Planning and Scoping</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Define the scope of the assessment (e.g., internal/external network, web applications, cloud infrastructure).</li>
<li>Identify assets, stakeholders, and compliance requirements.</li>
<li>Determine the tools and methodologies to be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discovery and Enumeration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct reconnaissance to gather information about target systems.</li>
<li>Use network mapping tools (e.g., Nmap) to discover active hosts and services.</li>
<li>Enumerate open ports, running services, and system details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerability Identification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use automated and manual methods to identify known vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Leverage databases like CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), NVD (National Vulnerability Database), and vendor advisories.</li>
<li>Employ vulnerability scanning tools such as Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerability Analysis and Risk Prioritization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assess the severity of identified vulnerabilities using CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores.</li>
<li>Correlate findings with real-world exploitability data (e.g., Metasploit, Exploit DB).</li>
<li>Prioritize vulnerabilities based on business impact, exploitability, and criticality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reporting and Remediation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Document findings, including risk ratings, affected systems, and potential impact.</li>
<li>Provide actionable remediation steps (patching, configuration changes, compensating controls).</li>
<li>Collaborate with IT and security teams to implement fixes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Mr Robot CTF is a medium level linux based machine offered by TryHackMe. We have to find the keys inorder to complete this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enumeration&#34;&gt;Enumeration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;nmap-scan&#34;&gt;Nmap Scan&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of we start with scanning the target&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo nmap -sT -T4 -p- -sV 10.10.134.174
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nmap results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Nmap scan report for 10.10.134.174
Host is up (0.17s latency).
Not shown: 65532 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT    STATE  SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  closed ssh
80/tcp  open   http     Apache httpd
443/tcp open   ssl/http Apache httpd

Service detection performed. 
Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 352.56 seconds
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a 2 open ports both of them have a webserver running one has SSL/HTTP at port 443 and the other is HTTP at port 80.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h3 id="enumeration">Enumeration</h3>
<h4 id="nmap-scan">Nmap Scan</h4>
<p>First of we start with scanning the target</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo nmap -sT -T4 -p- -sV 10.10.134.174
</code></pre><p>Nmap results:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Nmap scan report for 10.10.134.174

</code></pre><p>We have a 2 open ports both of them have a webserver running one has SSL/HTTP at port 443 and the other is HTTP at port 80.</p>
<p>Opening the web app in the browser provides us with an interesting interface in which we aren&rsquo;t interested.</p>
<p>Examining the webapp for common directories I stumbled across the <code>/robots.txt</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>Content of which were as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
</code></pre><p>For the first key we have the end point <code>/key-1-of-3.txt</code>.</p>
<p>We also found the <code>/fsocity.dic</code> endpoint which has a wordlist which might come in handy later.</p>
<h4 id="directory-busting">Directory Busting</h4>
<p>Now moving on, we need to do directory busting to find new endpoints, we employ DirBuster for this task:</p>
<p><img src="/media/dirb.png" alt="DirBuster"></p>
<p>This yields us some really interesting results:
<code>/license</code>
<code>/login</code></p>
<p>Visiting the <code>/license</code> endpoint we get:</p>
<p><img src="/media/license.png" alt="/license"></p>
<p>Scrolling further down we are greeted with a base64 string which screams &ldquo;password&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="/media/string.png" alt="/license"></p>
<p>After decoding the base64 string we found we get not only the password but also the username which quite matches the theme of this box:
User: <code>Elliot</code>
Password: <code>ER28-0652</code></p>
<p>Now equipped with user and password we move on to the <code>/login</code> endpoint.</p>
<p><img src="/media/login.png" alt="login"></p>
<p>We login with the credentials we have and we get a wordpress dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="/media/dash.png" alt="dashboard"></p>
<h3 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h3>
<p>Poking around I found the theme editorhiding in plainsight, this bad boy could be our way in.</p>
<p><img src="/media/404.png" alt="editor"></p>
<p>Now we have access to some code that can be manipulated and used to gain a reverse shell on the target, what we need to do is replace the code for 404.php with a reverse shell.</p>
<p>Before we execute the reverse shell file on the target we need to setup a listener on our host.
For that we have netcat.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>rlwrap nc -lvnp 1234
</code></pre><p>Using rlwrap is not necessary but it&rsquo;s the quality of life stuff. Now we have our listener up and running.</p>
<p><img src="/media/nc.png" alt="listener"></p>
<p>Executing our reverse shell by visiting the URL: <code>http://10.10.134.174/wp-includes/themes/TwentyFifteen/404.php</code></p>
<p>We get a shell.</p>
<p><img src="/media/shell.png" alt="shell"></p>
<p>We land as daemon which is not privileged enough to access the &ldquo;key&rdquo; file so we need to change to a system user which in this case is &ldquo;robot&rdquo; it&rsquo;s password is given in a md5 hash.</p>
<p>We crack the hash using John the Ripper and the fsocity.dic wordlist we found earlier, now we have the password: <code>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</code></p>
<p>Now inorder to change the user we need to have an interactive shell which right now we don&rsquo;t, so to make the current shell interactive we simply use:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>python -c &#39;import pty;pty.spawn(&#34;/bin/bash&#34;)&#39;
</code></pre><p>And we have an interactive shell</p>
<p><img src="/media/key2.png" alt="shell"></p>
<p>Now we can easily obtain the second key.</p>
